# Lab 8 - Starter
## 1) In your own words: Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?
 - Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
 - Manually run them locally before pushing code
 - Run them all after all development is completed

All three of these are acceptable options but we will more than likely be testing with github actions on successful merges.

## 2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
- No.
